Finally we at The *Virtual Research Group Edirom* (ViFE) have agreed to invest into a new endeavour, namely providing more documentation for our tools and concepts.

This site is to become the new home of a user oriented guidance through the domain of digital music edition. Of course there will be a focus on the **tools** developed by _ViFE_ but we will happily include information about any tool out there that helps in creating digital music edition.

But not only tools are to be described; **worflows** might even be more important. There might be many steps in creating a digital music edition that do not have a ready made tool at hand; nevertheless a solid workflow using existing software to accomplish your data tasks is better than any unmaintained tool. Besides developing an idealised workflow to work in the context of _Edirom Online_ or digital music edition in general, wer are hoping to provide helpful insights into the workflows we use in our different **projects** and, of course, welcome everyone to contribute their workflows.
